# End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project-Using-MLOPS

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a US visa application
will be **Certified** or **Denied** based on applicant and job-related features.

The primary goal of this project is to practice **modular coding**
and understand the structure of an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline**.

## Problem Statement
US visa applications go through a certification process based on
multiple factors such as job role, wages, employer details, and location.

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning pipeline
that can learn patterns from historical visa application data and
predict the likelihood of certification.
